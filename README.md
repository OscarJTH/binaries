You may find all packages under the packages folder.  
All credits goes to the developers themselves, I just compiled and gather them here.

* Nmap (Linux x86_64) 7.92 with OpenSSL 1.1.1k  
2. [MASSCAN](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) provides a super fast IP port scanner, and is super easy to build.
